# Face Recognition Based Attendance System

The project is designed to capture and recognize the faces of students or employees in real time, then mark their attendance by storing their information in an Excel file. It employs several essential Python libraries, including  Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI), OpenCV (cv2) for image processing and face detection/recognition, Pillow (PIL) for handling image manipulation, and Pandas for creating and updating the Excel file where the attendance records are saved. The ultimate goal of this project is to offer a solution that is fast, accurate, secure, and easy to manage for both small and large groups.

# Key Modules and Libraries
Several Python libraries are crucial to the success of this project. Each module plays a specific role in ensuring the system runs smoothly and efficiently, as shown in figure 01.
 
## Tkinter:
Tkinter is used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI) of the system. It provides the platform through which users interact with the system, such as registering their faces and checking attendance. Tkinter’s simplicity and flexibility make it ideal for building desktop applications.

## OpenCV (cv2):
OpenCV is a powerful library for computer vision tasks. In this project, OpenCV is responsible for detecting and recognizing faces from the camera feed. It provides the face detection and recognition algorithms that form the backbone of the system’s functionality.
## Pillow (PIL):
Pillow is a library used for image processing. It helps in handling and manipulating images during the registration and recognition processes. In this project, Pillow is primarily used for image preprocessing to ensure the captured images meet the standards required for face recognition.
## Pandas:
Pandas is used to create and update the Excel file where attendance records are saved. It provides efficient data management and makes it easy to work with large datasets, ensuring the attendance records are stored accurately and can be easily retrieved.
